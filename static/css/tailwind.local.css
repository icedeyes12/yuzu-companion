/* Tailwind CSS Local Fallback */
/* This file serves as a fallback if the CDN is unavailable */

/* IMPORTANT: This file needs to be processed with Tailwind CLI before deployment */
/* The @tailwind directives below are not valid in browsers without processing */

/* To generate a compiled version, run: */
/* npx tailwindcss -o static/css/tailwind.local.css --minify */

/* For now, this file acts as a placeholder and documentation */
/* The CDN version will be used in most cases */

/* If you need a working fallback without build tools, download a pre-compiled */
/* Tailwind CSS from: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com and save it here */
