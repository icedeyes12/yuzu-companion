## What Even Is This?

Honestly, what are you looking for here? This is just another AI project. 

You know what's more interesting? Mending scroll **[Fesnuk](https://www.facebook.com/groups/programmerhandal/)**. Or maybe some cat videos on YouTube.

Seriously, go scroll some social media. This code isn't going to entertain you like that latest meme trend.

## No Really, What Does It Do?

It's an AI companion. It talks. It remembers things. Sometimes it generates images. 

But let's be real - you're probably just here because you're bored. Might as well go watch some TikTok.

## Installation

If you insist on actually installing this, go read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions.

But honestly, just ask ChatGPT. It will explain it better.

## For the People Actually Reading This

If you're still here, congratulations on your attention span. This is an intimate AI companion system with:

- Emotional bonding protocols
- Multimodal interaction (text + images)
- Session-based memory
- Encrypted conversations
- Web and terminal interfaces

But honestly, you could have just asked ChatGPT to explain it.

## Disclaimer

All code is AI-generated. The developer just pressed some buttons and prayed.

Now go away and do something more productive. Like scrolling through memes.
