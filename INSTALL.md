## Installation Guide

Why are you reading this? Just ask [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/copilot).

Seriously, it will give you better instructions than I ever could.

## But If You Insist...

### Step 1: Don't
Consider if you really need to install this. Maybe go outside, touch some grass instead.

### Step 2: Fine, Here Are Some Hints
- You'll need Python (obviously)
- There are some requirements in a file somewhere
- You might need API keys for things
- Something about a database

### Step 3: Actually Just Use This
```bash
# I don't know, figure it out
pip install something
python something.py
```

Step 4: When It Breaks

Don't come crying to me. Go ask [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/copilot) like a normal person.

Real Talk

If you actually need to install this for some reason, maybe check the actual documentation, that doesn't exist. Or just run `python main.py` and see what happens. What's the worst that could happen?

Final Warning

This project is maintained by someone who thinks comments are for weaklings and documentation is a myth. You've been warned.

Good luck, you'll need it.
